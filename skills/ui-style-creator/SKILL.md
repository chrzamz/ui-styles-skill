# UI Style Creator

Turn the user's taste and product needs into a reusable local style profile. Keep the conversation in the user's language and explain choices using visible outcomes, not design terminology they must learn.

This skill is self-contained. A parent skill may read this file directly; a host may also install this folder as a separate skill. Nested folders are not assumed to be automatically discovered.

## Establish the design

1. Read the product's existing visual guidance, theme files, component library and a representative page. Keep an established design unless the user asked to change it. A custom profile must fit the actual framework and product tasks.
2. Use the user's brief, selected built-in style, or supplied reference as the starting point. Explain the proposed visual direction with a small representative UI sample. Ask only about decisions that materially change the result; infer routine details and state assumptions. If the user already selected a direction, continue without asking them to choose again.
3. Separate observed reference facts from newly proposed rules. A screenshot cannot prove hover, focus, error, loading or mobile behavior. Specify those missing states and verify them in the actual UI when implementation is in scope.
4. Write a concise visual specification and, when exact values are settled, a token file. Follow the [profile format](references/profile-format.md). Preserve real requirements, existing components and interaction semantics; don't replace the product with a style demo.

## Choose the scope and save

- **Project** is the default: `<project>/.ui-styles/profiles/<slug>/`.
- **User** is for an explicit request to reuse a style across projects: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/ui-styles/profiles/<slug>/`.
- User profiles are optional recipes. They do not become defaults for every project or override an existing brand. Before exporting a project design to user scope, remove private content, customer identifiers, credentials and machine-specific paths; keep portable design rules.
- Prefer one relevant profile over a profile for every minor edit. Use a new slug for a deliberate variant. The helper refuses existing targets; when a user asks to update an existing profile, inspect and edit its specific files in place with normal file tools, preserving unrelated content.

Use `scripts/profiles.py` to save prepared files. Replace the example paths and slug with the actual task's paths. The script validates inputs before writing, supports `--dry-run`, and never invents a color palette.

```sh
python3 <skill-root>/scripts/profiles.py create calm-editorial \
  --scope project --project /path/to/project \
  --design /path/to/prepared-visual-system.md \
  --tokens /path/to/prepared-tokens.json \
  --description "Editorial reading product with clear navigation" \
  --source "User brief and selected reference"

python3 <skill-root>/scripts/profiles.py list \
  --scope project --project /path/to/project

python3 <skill-root>/scripts/profiles.py create calm-editorial \
  --scope user --design /path/to/portable-visual-system.md
```

`--tokens` is optional when the design is still qualitative. Report missing exact values; do not claim such a profile is ready for automatic theme export. The helper only stores the profile. It does not install libraries, activate themes or change agent settings.

## Apply and carry the design forward

When application is part of the requested work, continue through the parent `ui-styles` workflow if available. If used independently:

1. Adapt the selected profile into the project's existing visual specification, retaining its path. When none exists, use `design/visual-system.md`; use `design/tokens.json` for settled portable token values. A profile is reusable source material; the project files describe the active design.
2. Resolve conflicts against the user's latest explicit requirements and existing project decisions. Copy only the selected rules and tokens, with a source profile name/version, so later edits to a user profile cannot silently change a project.
3. Reuse the installed library's theme API after checking its version and official documentation. Token mappings are adapters, not proof of equivalent components. Record any additional component styling and unsupported decisions.
4. Within the authorized project work, add or update a short reference in the relevant host's existing instruction file so future UI tasks read the active visual specification before building a demo or choosing a library. Preserve other instructions; do not modify global agent settings as a side effect. Generic Markdown is portable, but automatic loading depends on each host's entrypoint.
5. For implementation work, inspect representative desktop/mobile views and relevant states. Distinguish a saved specification from an implemented or visually verified theme. For a save-only request, stop after the profile is saved and report its path and scope.

When handing off, explain the chosen direction, profile location/scope, active project specification, how to reuse it, and what was actually verified. Keep undecided choices visible without making the user manage a design process.
